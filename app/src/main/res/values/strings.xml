    <string name="bio"> Hi friends, I\'m Simon Francisco, I\'m from Angola.
    \n\nIt\'s a pleasure to be here. I\'m now trying to learn Android Development and although the process
    isn\'t easy, it\'s very rewarding. I\'m trying my best.
    \n\nIt may not be good enough, but it\'s my best.
    \n\nThe journey is not one of the easiest, lots of obstacles, stumbling blocks and so on.
        But I know that my Redeemer lives and with my own eyes I shall see His face.
    \n\nLet this be the start of something great, the Lord is my witness.
    \n\nMay God help us, amen!</string>
